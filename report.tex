\section*{Firefox OS Asynchronized Request}
In Firefox OS, app is treated as web page. Web apps need to access device hardware (such as battery status or the device vibration hardware), as well as access to data stored on the device (such as the calendar or contacts list). This is achieved via WebAPI. % introduce WebAPI

Most WebAPIs need to send asynchronized request to access device resource. We use contacts API as an example. When app sends request to get contact from contacts list,  it calls contacts API and registers onSuccess and onError event handlers which are the callback functions to handle response of the API call. % call asynchronized WebAPI

Contacts API will generate a random ID for the request and store request in array. Then sends get-contact request to system and return DOMRequest object. DomRequest object will contain the search result from contacts list after receiving response of contacts API. Addtionally, in order to identify which frame sends the request, DOMRequest includes DOMWindow which is created for each frame. % send request 

%receive response
